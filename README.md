Workflow for analysis of hyperspectral datasets, in transmisison and electron yield mode.

Step 1: data are acquired in transmission and total electron yield mode

Step 2: data are preprocessed for drift correction and normalized

Step 3: images are reduced to a few components by performing a dimensionality reduction technique (ICA, PCA etc)

Step 4: clustering (k-means, GMM etc) is performed to these components to create the clustered transmission and electron yield image

Scanning x-ray microscopy data for cycled Ti3C2 MXene with oxygen termiantions. Clustered image, acquired from transmission (electron yield) data at O K-edge, and corresponding transmission (electron yield) XA spectra. Areas of MXene (green), separator (yellow), and electrolyte residues (red) are shown. 

### Curve fitting of NEXAFS data

The curve fitting analysis involves background subtraction with a background function (arc tangent) to remove the excitation of core electrons to the continuum or quasi-continuum states. Peak fitting is performed with Gaussian functions.
