Step 1: data are acquired in transmission and total electron yield mode

Step 2: data are preprocessed for drift correction and normalized

Step 3: images are reduced to a few components by performing a dimensionality reduction technique (ICA, PCA etc)

Step 4: clustering (k-means, GMM etc) is performed to these components to create the clustered transmission and electron yield image

SXM data for cycled MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene. a Transmission image at the O K-edge, along with b the clustered image and c corresponding transmission XA spectra. e TEY image at the O K-edge, along with f the clustered image and g corresponding TEY spectra. Areas of MXene (green), separator (yellow), and electrolyte residues (red) are shown. c Comparative analysis at the Ti L-edge in d both transmission and h TEY modes for pristine and cycled MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene. The spectra at O K- and Ti L-edge of pristine MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene (blue) are added for comparison. An inset with fitted spectra of the pre-edge of pristine and cycled MXene is included.

Fitted spectra at O K-edge for cycled MXene in LP30 electrolyte. (a) OD spectra at O K-edge, for pristine MXene (blue), cycled MXene (green) with signs of Li-O bond (cyan peak) and carbonates interacted with MXene (red). (b) Corresponding TEY spectra for carbonates with trace of oxygen bond to titanium.
