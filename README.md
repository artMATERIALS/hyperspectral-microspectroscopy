a Workflow for spectromicroscopic data, collected for multilayered MS-Ti3C2Tx MXene. Images in transmission and TEY mode, acquired at Ti L-edge (step 1) are preprocessed for drift correction and normalization (step 2). Then, images are reduced to a few components by performing a dimensionality reduction (step 3). Clustering is performed to these components to create the clustered transmission and TEY image (step 4). Clustered spectrum is extracted by averaging the preprocessed spectra, corresponding to pixels of a clustered area. Clustered spectra are shown in b for transmission and c for TEY mode. Cluster 1-3 and clusters I-III are produced after clustering separately the preprocessed transmission and TEY data, respectively.

SXM data for cycled MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene. a Transmission image at the O K-edge, along with b the clustered image and c corresponding transmission XA spectra. e TEY image at the O K-edge, along with f the clustered image and g corresponding TEY spectra. Areas of MXene (green), separator (yellow), and electrolyte residues (red) are shown. c Comparative analysis at the Ti L-edge in d both transmission and h TEY modes for pristine and cycled MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene. The spectra at O K- and Ti L-edge of pristine MS-etched Ti3C2Tx MXene (blue) are added for comparison. An inset with fitted spectra of the pre-edge of pristine and cycled MXene is included.

Fitted spectra at O K-edge for cycled MXene in LP30 electrolyte. (a) OD spectra at O K-edge, for pristine MXene (blue), cycled MXene (green) with signs of Li-O bond (cyan peak) and carbonates interacted with MXene (red). (b) Corresponding TEY spectra for carbonates with trace of oxygen bond to titanium.
